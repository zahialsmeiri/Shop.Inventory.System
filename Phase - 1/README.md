# Shop Inventory System – Phase One

## Project Overview
This project is a simple console-based Java application developed as part of the *Programming I* course.  
The system simulates a basic shop transaction for a single product and generates an invoice based on user input.

The main purpose of this project is to practice:
- User input handling  
- Conditional statements  
- Basic calculations  
- Output formatting  

No advanced concepts such as loops, arrays, methods, or OOP are used.

## Features
The system provides the following features:
- Reads product information from the user:
  - Product name  
  - Unit price  
  - Quantity purchased  
- Validates input values  
- Applies discount based on quantity  
- Displays a formatted invoice  
- Handles invalid input with error messages  

---

## Business Rules
- Unit price must be greater than zero.  
- Quantity must be greater than zero.  
- If quantity is **10 or more**, a **10% discount** is applied.  
- If input is invalid, the program terminates.
