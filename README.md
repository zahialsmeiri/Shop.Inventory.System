# 🛒 Shop Inventory System

**Programming I – Course Project (Fall 2025)**  
Console-based Java application

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Shop Inventory System** is a cumulative Java project developed throughout the *Programming I* course.  
Instead of separate assignments, this project evolves step-by-step as new programming concepts are introduced.

The system simulates a simple shop where users can manage products, calculate invoices, and interact with an inventory through a console interface.

Throughout the project, the following concepts are applied:

- Conditional logic  
- Loops and menus  
- Arrays for data storage  
- Searching and sorting algorithms  
- Program refactoring using methods  
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Each phase builds on the previous one, reflecting how real-world software systems grow incrementally.

## 🚀 Project Phases

### Phase One: Fundamentals and Decision Making

**Focus**
- Problem analysis  
- Variables and data types  
- User input  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Conditional statements  

**Key Characteristics**
- Program runs once and exits  
- Handles one product at a time  
- Input validation  
- Displays a simple invoice  

**Learning Outcome**  
Understanding how to translate a real-world problem into a working Java program.

---

### Phase Two: Loops and Menu-Driven Programs

**Focus**
- Repetition  
- Continuous user interaction  

**Key Characteristics**
- Menu-based system  
- Program runs until user exits  
- Phase One logic reused inside loops  

**Learning Outcome**  
Learning how loops control program flow and enable interactive programs.

---

### Phase Three: Arrays and Multiple Products

**Focus**
- Managing multiple records  

**Key Characteristics**
- Parallel arrays for product data  
- Each index represents one product  
- Fixed-size inventory  

**Learning Outcome**  
Transition from single variables to structured collections of data.

---

### Phase Four: Searching and Sorting

**Focus**
- Data processing and organization  

**Key Characteristics**
- Search for products  
- Sort products by name or price  
- Maintain data consistency  

**Learning Outcome**  
Developing algorithmic thinking and improving program usability.

---

### Final Phase: Methods and Object-Oriented Programming

**Focus**
- Code structure and maintainability  

**Key Characteristics**
- Code split into methods  
- Introduction of classes  
- Use of objects to combine data and behavior  

**Learning Outcome**  
Transition from procedural programming to object-oriented design.

## 📐 Rules and Constraints

### General Rules
- All previous phases must remain functional  
- Features cannot be removed  
- Code must be readable and well organized  

### Restricted Concepts
- No Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)  
- No file handling or databases  
- No advanced OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)  

These restrictions ensure the project matches the Programming I level.
